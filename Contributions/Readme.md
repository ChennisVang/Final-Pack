This class has been really good to me and the professor was really tough on us but it was for the best. I learned a lot from this class. What I can potentially do for the future and going beyond my limits. This class was really hard and challenging but nothing in life is easy. I really like the layout of this class because you don't have a guideline to follow, you can be yourself and be creative. Everyone in my group for the group project contributed equally. This class was really fun.
